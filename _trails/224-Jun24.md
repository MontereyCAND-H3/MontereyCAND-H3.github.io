Come one, cum all, to the Monterey Red Dress run!
This month we're raising running with our annual red dress run for the Monterey SPCA!
Join us and then give us some extra money for donations!

It's like the olde classic hashing song the S&M Man says:

```
Who can take a puppy
And the cutest red dress
Raise some money for the shelter
while running helter skelter!
```

Yea, don't worry, I won't quit my day job.

But join us for a fun of running around downtown looking dashing and raising money for charity!

On-on!
